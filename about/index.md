Hey there! My name is Riley Davis and I'm the lead front-end developer with the [Coral Project](https://coralproject.net), a Knight/Mozilla Foundation partnership where we're building open-source tools for publishers to help engender better community on their websites. 

Before that, I was a product engineer at Tumblr working on the creator tools. And even before *that*, I was with the New York Times and helped create the [T Brand Studio](http://www.tbrandstudio.com/). 

Currently I'm living in the Denver area because the mountains are calling, and I must go. And because the beer scene here is phenomenal.
